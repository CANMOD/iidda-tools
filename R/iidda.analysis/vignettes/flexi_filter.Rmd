# What is `flexi_filter` for?
The IIDDA api is designed to allow users to obtain filtered subseets of the
data. The function `iidda.analysis::flexi_filter` enables filtering IIDDA
datasets with regex queries. `flexi_filter` is [currently] bare-bones; searches
that involve filtering on more than one field simultaneously usually have to be
be handled by joining the results of two or more separate calls to
`flexi_filter`.
