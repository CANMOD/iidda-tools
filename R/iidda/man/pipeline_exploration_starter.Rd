}
\arguments{
\item{script_filename}{Name for the generated script.}

\item{exploration_project_path}{Path to the folder for containing the script.

\description{
Create an R script providing a place to start when exploring an IIDDA
pipeline.
}
\details{
The R script has the following:

1. Example code for printing out the data sources and datasets
in the IIDDA pipeline repository.
2. Code for finding the paths to datasets and to the scripts for generating
them.
3. Code for generating and/or reading in a user-selected IIDDA
dataset.

Once the data are read in, the user is free to do whatever they want to
with it.
